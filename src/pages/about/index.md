* Reiki Tenohira (hands on healing). This is currently not being offered, due to the effects of Covid -19.
* Distant Reiki healing.
* Guided meditations supported by distant Reiki healing to explore your inner landscapes in a variety of ways.
* The Reiki Rhythm drum sound healing for specific physical ailments, general wellbeing, releasing limiting self-belief and setting empowering truths.
* Drum journeys: I can facilitate your own healing journey, or undertake a journey on your behalf. This can include accessing information or wisdom for a specific issue, finding your power words for your life/soul path, meeting your animal guardian, meeting your guides and soul part retrieval.
